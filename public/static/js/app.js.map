&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;成立于1850年悉尼大学从一开始就革新改变了联合王国的古典大学以血统而不以成绩收生的传统。学者和政客的激烈争论促使英国和北美的大学随之改变以应社会发展，悉尼大学亦成为了其他殖民地新兴大学的榜样。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1858年2月27日，维多利亚女王授予悉尼大学皇家宪章，使其与英国的大学拥有相同的地位。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 在19世纪下半期，悉尼大学形成了助学和捐赠的文化潮流，Charles Badham教授就是其中的先驱者，他认为所有有能力的学生都应当享有大学教育并争取设立奖学金以应学生在攻读过程中的不时之需。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 时至今日，悉尼大学每年都会收到澳洲大学最高的捐赠，而2012年每八位悉尼大学的在读学生，就有一位享有大学奖学金的资助。 <br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 从1881年起，悉尼大学开始招收女生，成为世界上最早允许女生授学的学府之一，比起牛津大学或剑桥大学早了至少数十年。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1901年，悉尼大学的毕业生，埃德蒙·巴顿建立了澳大利亚联邦并成为了澳大利亚第一任总理。<br

/>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;成立于1850年悉尼大学从一开始就革新改变了联合王国的古典大学以血统而不以成绩收生的传统。学者和政客的激烈争论促使英国和北美的大学随之改变以应社会发展，悉尼大学亦成为了其他殖民地新兴大学的榜样。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t1858年2月27日，维多利亚女王授予悉尼大学皇家宪章，使其与英国的大学拥有相同的地位。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t在19世纪下半期，悉尼大学形成了助学和捐赠的文化潮流，Charles Badham教授就是其中的先驱者，他认为所有有能力的学生都应当享有大学教育并争取设立奖学金以应学生在攻读过程中的不时之需。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t时至今日，悉尼大学每年都会收到澳洲大学最高的捐赠，而2012年每八位悉尼大学的在读学生，就有一位享有大学奖学金的资助。\n\t\t\t<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t从1881年起，悉尼大学开始招收女生，成为世界上最早允许女生授学的学府之一，比起牛津大学或剑桥大学早了至少数十年。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t1901年，悉尼大学的毕业生，埃德蒙·巴顿建立了澳大利亚联邦并成为了澳大利亚第一任总理。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t悉尼大学的1800名师生参加了第一次世界大战，197人牺牲，4000名师生参加了第二次世界大战，250人牺牲，今天在悉尼大学钟楼下面，仍能找到纪念他们的饰板。\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"profile\">\n\t\t\t<span

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\tANU校园内设有银行、邮局、书店、药妆店、贩卖部、咖啡屋、小酒吧、餐厅、旅行社，坐拥南半球规模最大的图书馆；另备有完善的体育设施、学生医疗中心、画廊、博物馆、音乐厅等。<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\t\t\t此外，堪培拉座落众多的国家级文化和学术机构，如澳洲联邦科学与工业研究组织（CSIRO）、澳洲科学院（AAS）、澳洲人文科学院、澳洲社会科学院（ASSA）、澳洲国家植物园、澳洲国家图书馆、澳洲国立美术馆、澳洲国立博物馆、澳洲国家档案馆、澳洲国立影片与声音档案馆、澳洲国家生物标准实验室、澳洲地质调查组织（AGSO）、澳洲犯罪学研究所（AIC）、澳洲战争纪念馆、国家肖像美术馆、堪培拉博物馆暨美术馆和国家首都展览馆等等。ANU与这些机构有着紧密的联系和合作。\n\t\t\t<img

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;成立于1850年悉尼大学从一开始就革新改变了联合王国的古典大学以血统而不以成绩收生的传统。学者和政客的激烈争论促使英国和北美的大学随之改变以应社会发展，悉尼大学亦成为了其他殖民地新兴大学的榜样。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1858年2月27日，维多利亚女王授予悉尼大学皇家宪章，使其与英国的大学拥有相同的地位。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 在19世纪下半期，悉尼大学形成了助学和捐赠的文化潮流，Charles Badham教授就是其中的先驱者，他认为所有有能力的学生都应当享有大学教育并争取设立奖学金以应学生在攻读过程中的不时之需。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 时至今日，悉尼大学每年都会收到澳洲大学最高的捐赠，而2012年每八位悉尼大学的在读学生，就有一位享有大学奖学金的资助。 <br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 从1881年起，悉尼大学开始招收女生，成为世界上最早允许女生授学的学府之一，比起牛津大学或剑桥大学早了至少数十年。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1901年，悉尼大学的毕业生，埃德蒙·巴顿建立了澳大利亚联邦并成为了澳大利亚第一任总理。<br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\"><br _v-7c84c9c4=\\\"\\\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 悉尼大学的1800名师生参加了第一次世界大战，197人牺牲，4000名师生参加了第二次世界大战，250人牺牲，今天在悉尼大学钟楼下面，仍能找到纪念他们的饰板。 </div> </div> <div class=profile
